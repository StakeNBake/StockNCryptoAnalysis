# StockNCrypto Analysis
Investment analysis of stocks and crypto based on ticker symbol with Telegram bot automation ðŸ“ˆ

This project works both locally and externally through Telegram Chat.

StockðŸ’µ and CryptoðŸª™ prices can be monitored and analyzed locally by simply adjusting the date ranges and ticker symbol. 
Other analyses can be conducted at the bottom inorder to compare assets against other assets.

Comment out Telegram Bot packages and libraries to disregard that setup. Data can be obtained from Binance (or Coingecko API) and Yahoo Finance rather than OpenBB Terminals.
